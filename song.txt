Hop-Hey-_HEeeeey-LA_LA-Ley
the best song EVER
New Changes


Some new line

and Another one

song for pushing 


Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field


Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
 
March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
